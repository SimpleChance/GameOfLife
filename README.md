# **Conway's Game Of Life**
*by Chance Jewell*

---

## Description
This is a small python project meant to explore different forms of emergent behavior, through various implementations of
John Conway's Game of Life (GOL).

## Goals
* Short Term - 
  * Develop a simple PyGame environment to handle input and render various 2D implementations of GOL
  * Develop a GameEngine class to encapsulate different GOL logic and data structures
* Long Term - 
  * Implement a game menu/settings window and the ability to save/load game states
  * Provide support for higher dimensional environments
  * Refactor project as a deployable application

---

## TODO - 
* GameEngine class:
* Polish the Renderer class
* Implement main simulation loop and input detection
